# Description
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior and viewing patterns across different program types (e.g., movies, series, episodes). The goal is to understand how users interact with various programs and identify trends in watch time and program popularity.

## Objective
- Identify the most watched programs and episodes.
- Analyze average watch time per user and per program type.
- Explore customer engagement and viewing preferences.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas** for data aggregation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** for visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

  ## Key Findings
  1. Most Popular Programs:

The Boss Baby captured the largest share of total watch time at 20.4%.
The Expendables ranked second with 13.8%.
The movie Moana came in third with 10.9%.
These results indicate that children's and action programs are highly popular among users.
2.Content Diversity:

The top-watched programs span various categories, such as Animation and Action.
The data shows significant interest in animation, as The Boss Baby, Moana, Trolls, The amazing pider-Man (with a spelling error noted), and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs are all animated films or series.

3. Most Watched Genres:

Animation Movies dominate the top ten most-watched programs list, suggesting this category is the primary driver of total watch time.
Action Movies are strongly represented by The Expendables.
This genre diversity shows that the target audience is varied with different interests, but the animation category is the most consumed.


## Recommendations
Based on these findings, it is recommended to focus on:
Increasing Content for Children and Families: Given the high popularity of animated films, investing in more similar programs is advisable.
Enhancing High-Quality Content: Programs with an HD label, such as Moana (HD), appear on the top-watched list, confirming that display quality plays a crucial role in attracting users.
